Project Requirement Document: CircuTrade AI
Subtitle: A Decentralized Circular Economy Marketplace for Verified Industrial Waste

1. Project Overview
CircuTrade AI is a B2B platform that digitizes the fragmented waste ecosystem. It uses Computer Vision (OpenCV) for pre-verification, a Django-based Marketplace for matching, and a Blockchain-inspired Ledger for tracking the lifecycle of waste from "bin to board-room."

2. User Roles & Dashboards
A. The Waste Generator (Small Factories / Aggregators)
Goal: List waste and get a fair, instant price.

Dashboard Features:

Verification Hub: UI for "Insta-Grade" image/video scans.

Karma Stats: Current reputation score (influences visibility).

Listing Manager: Active sales, weight sold, and total earnings.

B. The Buyer (Manufacturers / Recyclers)
Goal: Source high-quality, verified raw materials with proof of sustainability.

Dashboard Features:

Resource Feed: Filterable marketplace (Grade A PET, Grade B Cotton, etc.).

Provenance Vault: Timeline views of purchased material history.

ESG Report: Auto-generated stats on CO2 saved through purchases.

C. The Informal Worker (Nokia 1100 / Tier-3 Users)
Goal: Get paid digitally and build a professional identity.

Feature: Simplified SMS/WhatsApp Interface (Simulated) for status updates and payment receipts.

3. Functional Requirements (The "What")
Feature	Requirement Description	Logic / Integration
Multi-Modal Verification	App must accept OpenCV data (Material Type, Grade, Trust Score).	Reject listings with Trust < 50%.
Blockchain Provenance	Every status change must create a cryptographically linked log entry.	Use SHA-256 hashing in a post_save signal.
Smart Matching	Match buyers to sellers based on location and material specs.	Django .filter() query in the Marketplace view.
Karma Staking	Sellers must "lock" reputation points to list high-value items.	Model field karma_score logic.
Price Engine	Real-time "Fair Price" suggestion based on Grade and Weight.	Dictionary-based logic: BasePrice * GradeMultiplier.
4. Non-Functional Requirements (The "How")
Security: All provenance logs must be immutable (read-only after creation).

Performance: The marketplace feed must load in under 1.5 seconds on mobile data.

Transparency: Every transaction must display its unique "Blockchain Hash" publicly.

Inclusion: Minimalist CSS for fast loading in low-connectivity (Tier 3) areas.

Integrity: The system must prevent "double-listing" of the same waste pile.

5. UI & Page Screens
Screen 1: The Landing Hub
Hero: "Your Waste is Someone Else's Raw Material."

CTA: [Login/Join] buttons and a live "Impact Counter" (Total CO2 Saved).

Screen 2: The Marketplace (Feed)
Layout: Vertical cards.

Card Info: Material thumbnail, Weight, Grade (A/B/C), and a "Verified" tick-mark.

Interaction: Clicking a card opens the Provenance Detail Page.

Screen 3: Provenance Detail (The Trust Page)
Top: Video audit frames (from OpenCV).

Middle: The Chain of Custody (Vertical timeline).

Bottom: "Download Sustainability Certificate" button.

6. Technical Schema (models.py Roadmap)
Python
class WasteListing(models.Model):
    # Marketplace Core
    material = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    weight = models.FloatField()
    base_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    
    # Quality Verification (From OpenCV)
    grade = models.CharField(choices=[('A','A'), ('B','B'), ('C','C')])
    trust_score = models.IntegerField() # 0-100
    is_verified = models.BooleanField(default=False)
    
    # Sustainability Metadata
    co2_saved = models.FloatField() # Auto-calculated weight * factor

class ProvenanceBlock(models.Model):
    listing = models.ForeignKey(WasteListing, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    status = models.CharField(max_length=50) # Scanned, Sold, Shipped
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    previous_hash = models.CharField(max_length=64)
    current_hash = models.CharField(max_length=64) # SHA-256
7. The 6-Hour Sprint Strategy
Phase 1 (Setup): Build the User & Waste models. Get the Marketplace page showing "Empty" state.

Phase 2 (The Vault): Code the ProvenanceBlock and the hashing function. This is your "Blockchain" differentiator.

Phase 3 (The Logic): Build the VerificationReceiver view that takes data from your teammate (OpenCV).

Phase 4 (The Polish): Use Bootstrap to make the Dashboards look clean. Add a "Digital Certificate" template.

Would you like me to generate the "Digital Certificate" HTML template that pulls data from the Blockchain logs for the final demo?
